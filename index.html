<center><p2>
Grandma Ilana was born in March 1993 in Iraq.<br/>
She has 7 brothers, 5 daughters, 13 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.<br/>
She immigrated to Israel with her parents in 1951. They settled in the Be'er Ya'akov crossing and lived in tents <br/>
till she married Jacob, god rest his soul.<br/>
Life in the aisles was difficult, distributing food in portions according to the number of children in the family.<br/>
<br/>
<b style="font-size:25px;">I interviewed Grandma about arriving in Israel:</b><br/>
the immigration from Iraq began in the 50s.<br/>
Some began to immigrate through Peres and some immigrated directly to Israel.<br/>
<b style="font-size:30px;">"</b>
Towards the end of the Aliyah, my brother worked in spare parts for cars, where grenades were thrown.<br/>
He came home and insisted that we move to Israel because of fear.<br/>
In April 1951, we prepared our passports. We were informed that all of our property belonged to Iraq and we could not take it<br/>
We arrived in Israel in August 1951. We sprayed with DDT. <br/>
We arrived at a place called "Shaar Haaliya" where all the Jews arrived.<br/>
We were there for a month and a half and then we moved to Beer Yaakov. 
<b style="font-size:30px;">"</b><br/><br/>
Ben Gurion was the one who organized the aliyah.<br/>
Within six months, almost all Iraqi Jews arrived. The planes were of England..<br/>
When they arrived in Beer Yaakov, they had to live for 9 people in one tent..<br/>
After 8 months they were given a wooden shack..<br/>
Her father was 60 and couldn't find a job. In Iraq he was a jeweler who owned a jewelry store..<br/>
When Ilana was 17, she started working in the orchard..<br/>
She and her sister picked oranges, lemons and cotton wool - without gloves..<br/>
Ilana got married in 1952 and moved to Holon.

<u>Web 1.0</u>
<br/>
Web 1.0 refers to the first stage of the World Wide Web evolution. <br>
Earlier, there were only few content creators in Web 1.0 with the huge majority of users who are consumers of content.<br> 
Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services.<br>
there is only limited interaction between sites and web users.<br>
Web 1.0 is simply an information portal where users passively receive information without being given the<br>
opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.<br>
Static pages. Content is served from the server’s file-system.<br>
<br/>
<br/>
<u>Web 2.0</u>
<br/>
Web 2.0 refers to world wide website which highlight user-generated content,<br>
usability and interoperability for end users. Web 2.0 is also called participative social web.<br>
It does not refer to a modification to any technical specification, but to modify in the way Web 
pages are designed and used<br>
A major difference is now Information flows between site owner and<br> 
site users by means of evaluation & online commenting.<br> 
As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant.<br>
<br/>
<br/>
<u>Web 3.0</u>
<br/>
It refers the evolution of web utilization and interaction which includes altering the Web into a database.<br> 
In enables the upgradation of back-end of the web, after a long time of focus on the front-end<br>
(Web 2.0 has mainly been about AJAX, tagging, and another front-end user-experience innovation).<br>
Web 3.0 is a term which is used to describe many evolutions of web usage and interaction among several paths.<br> 
In this, data isn’t owned but instead shared, where services show different views for the same web / the same data.<br>
A major difference is Semantic Web.<br>
The succeeding evolution of the Web involves the Semantic Web.<br> 
The semantic web improves web technologies in demand to create, share and connect content through<br> 
search and analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.<br>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u>Explanation of the differences by example of the use case</u>
<br/>
The question we "ask the web" is: "what are the side of Ritalin?"<br/>
When I will "ask the web" on web1.0<br/>
I will get static pages which indicate some common side effects with explanations.
<br/>
When I will "ask the web" on web3.0<br/> 
I will get dynamic pages which based on the wisdom of the crowd,
I will get interactive pages that have a lot of posts with a query like mine -<br/>
those pages contain a medical database based on more than trillion user posts
with a query like mine or queries in the same topic.
